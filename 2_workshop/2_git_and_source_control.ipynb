    "## What is source control?\n",
    "Source control is system specifically design to track changes in the code base over time, and to allow multiple people to work on the same code base at the same time. It is also known as version control or revision control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we need source control?\n",
    "Source control works somewhat differently to other cloud solution. In source control usually not syncing entire code bases, but only the changes in the code line by line. This allows for much more efficient collaboration, decreased syncing time as well as the ability to revert to previous versions of the code base. The later is because of the nature of source control (such that it tracks the changes rather than just uploads the entire code base)."

    "## Branching strategies\n",
    "There are multiple branching strategies in existance however we only going to talk about a few of them in this workshop.\\\n",
    " - Feature branching\n",
    " - Gitflow\n",
    " - Staging branching\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature branching\n",
    "Feature branching refers to the type of branching in which developer open a new branch for each feature then they merge that into main once the feature is completed. This is the most common branching strategy and is used by most companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "     /---feature1---\\\n",
    "---------------------x-----------x-----------------------x-------> \n",
    "                \\---feature2---/        \\---feature3---/\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Staging branching\n",
    "Staging branching is a branching strategy in which there is a staging branch that is used to test the code before merging it into main. This is useful when you want to test the code before merging it into main.\\\n",
    "In this scenario there is usually a development branch to which code is merged into usually, once the code is tested it is merged into staging, where at it tested in a more realistic environment and then into main or production at which it is closely monitored.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "main---------------------------x-------->\n",
    "                              /\n",

    "development--------------->\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gitflow\n",
    "Gitflow is a similar branching strategy to the combination of staging and feature branching, however it differs from that in the way that it changes the main and staging to one release branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "In the context of branching strategies, it is very common practice to run different pipelines on the different branches. For example, you might want to run a pipeline that only builds and tests the code on the development branch, but you might want to run a pipeline that builds, tests and deploys the code on the main branch.\n",
